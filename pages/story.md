Throughout history, many of the prominent events revolve around one thing: war. Many war profiteers failed, but one succeed. That company came to the realization that war wasn't where success lied; it was in office assassination games and contests. After the War of 1812, Jeff and Kar feared their business model and strategy would not survive in the world. It was in 1867, when the country of Canada was founded, that they finally found their true calling. <em>Jeff & Kar's Arms and Services</em> was founded to capitalize on the unbrindled chaos of office assassination games.

            Although some may think of him as just the <em>sports guy</em>... wait that's exactly what he is. But that knowledge transfers well into his ability to understand and create offensive and defensive strategies, and schemes for his clients.

            The guy does it all. Some would call him the brains of the operation, and they would be right. The intelligence and expansion of the company falls on the shoulders of Kar. Consistently finding new associates and inventing new products to aid his clients.
